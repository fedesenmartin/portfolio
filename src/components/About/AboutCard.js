            Hi Everyone, I am <span className="purple">Fede Senmartin</span> from <span className="purple">Buenos Aires, Argentina</span>.
            <br />
            With over 10 years in the software development industry, I specialize in delivering high-quality, performance-driven solutions. My expertise spans a wide range of languages, frameworks, and infrastructure knowledge, making me adaptable and driven by a commitment to excellence.
            <br />
            <br />
            Outside of work, Iâ€™m passionate about staying active through sports, sharing insights and experiences through blogging, and exploring new places while traveling. I find inspiration in connecting with diverse cultures and people who share these interests.
